Evolution-Simulator
===================

Created by Thomas Ring

Made for the 2013 Science Fair in Oregon, this started in Python and moved to Java in July 2012.

This simply simulates the process of evolution by creating organisms and forcing them to compete
for resources and reproduction.

Features:
• Organism reproduction and death
• Full UI scaling based on data

Future implementations include:
• Randomly generated names/shapes/colors for each organism (WIP)
• Organism migration across environments (Future update)
• Sexual/Asexual reproduction (Future update)
