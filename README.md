Evolution-Simulator
===================

Created by Thomas Ring

Made for ISOF 2013, this started in Python and moved to Java in July 2012.

This simply simulates the process of evolution by creating organisms and forcing them to compete
for resources and reproduction.

The simulation is modifiable to run under custom conditions, and data is obtainable and 
displayable in an data window after the simulation has ended for data comparison.


Features:
• Organism reproduction and death
• Organism migration across environments
• Control over organisms, passing of time, etc.

Future implementations include:
• Randomly generated names/shapes/colors for each organism (WIP)
• Sexual/Asexual reproduction (Future update)
